->Define digital forensics:
-Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that focuses on identifying, 
acquiring, processing, analysing, and reporting on data stored electronically.

-Electronic evidence is a component of almost all criminal activities and digital 
forensics support is crucial for law enforcement investigations.

-Electronic evidence can be collected from a wide array of sources, such as computers, 
smartphones, remote storage, unmanned aerial systems, shipborne equipment, and more.

-The main goal of digital forensics is to extract data from the electronic evidence, 
process it into actionable intelligence and present the findings for prosecution. 
All processes utilize sound forensic techniques to ensure the findings are admissible in court.

->Here are some of the most popular digital investigation tools:

-The SleuthKit
-OSForensic
-FTK Imager
-Hex Editor Neo
-Bulk Extracto

->Challenges Faced by Digital Forensics
-Due to the evidentiary nature of digital forensic science, 
rigorous standards are required to withstand cross-examination in court. 
Challenges faced by digital forensics are:

-Extracting data from locked, or destroyed computing devices is one of the challenges 
that digital forensic investigators face
-Finding specific data entries within massive amounts of data stored locally or in the cloud
-Keeping track of the digital chain of custody
-Ensuring data integrity throughout an investigation
